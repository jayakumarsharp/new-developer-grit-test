        <p>
            The "star dust" which makes a good programer great has very little to do with the IQ, communication skills or the ability to work in teams (even if those would help), but it is directly related to something called the GRIT (or the Drive), which is the ability to maintain determination and motivation over long periods despite experiences with failure and adversity.
