#Grit test for new developers


The "star dust" which makes a good programer great has very little to do with the IQ, communication skills or the ability to work in teams (even if those would help), but it is directly related to something called the GRIT (or the Drive), which is the ability to maintain determination and motivation over long periods despite experiences with failure and adversity.

There is no tracking on this application and you are the only one seeing the results, so please be honest when responding.

Of course, there are no right or wrong answers!
